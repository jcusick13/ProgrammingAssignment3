# ProgrammingAssignment3

Contains the peer-graded assignment for Coursera's Getting and Cleaning Data class.

The main script of this assignment, run_analysis.R, assumes that it will be run in
the same local directory as the UCI HAR Dataset, which can be downloaded from
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.

The script organizes and cleans the data from both the train and test datasets into
a single tidy data table. It also creates an independent summary table of selected
variables as described in the script's comments.
